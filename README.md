# ElectronAutoBuild
A small Python app that automatically builds Electron apps so you don't have to!


Add your code into the app and it will output a .exe file into your Downloads folder (Along with a log file)

I even provided the .py file if you want to build the app yourself!


(The app may not be good, but fork it if you can do better)
